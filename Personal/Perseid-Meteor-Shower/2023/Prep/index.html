                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This page is meant to give everyone the location of the campground and some other details you may need to prepare well. Generally speaking, Joshua Tree National Park is hot during the summer. The night of the meteor shower will likely be no exception. </p>

            <div class="location">
                <h2>Time & Location</h2>
                <p id="location-p">The location will be at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campsites/3504">Cottonwood Group Campground Site G03</a> in Joshua Tree National Park. The site has several shade structures, fire pits, and bathrooms nearby. There is plenty of space for tents so if you plan on staying the night, this is a good option.</p>

                <p>On Friday August 11, 2023, I will attempt to arrive at 6pm. Sunset is at 8pm and it may be difficult to set up your tents or other gear after dark. It may also make it difficult to find the site. </p>

                <h2>Weather</h2>
                <p>Warm <br> Last year, we had relatively cool weather. We had thunderstorms overhead which impeded our view of the Meteor Shower. Assume that this year it will not be as cool. Days are usually above 100F and nights are above 80F. Monsoonal thunderstorms are a possibility still.</p>
